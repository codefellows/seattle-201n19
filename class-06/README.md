# The DOM, Domain Modeling, and Introduction to Objects

<a id="top"></a>

## Weekly Feedback

### Cons

- The learning journals are pretty lame. If I wanted to write to someone about my coding progress, I'd send a letter to my decrepit grandmother in West Virginia.  If we have them why not make them optional and not graded.


### Pros

- The Labs and time spent in Remo with my teammates.

- The coding problems were awesome! Totally improve my understanding of functions and gave me a sneak peek of whats ahead. 

- I didn't think I would need the accountability partners, but one of them recently reached out to me for help which made me realize this could be a good way to network.


## Lecture

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 6 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate a real-world problem domain into a code model by using provided user stories and technical requirements, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how the browser represents an HTML document as an object that can be manipulated with JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically render array data as an unordered list in the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how object literals are structured in JavaScript, as well as how to access and reassign values/functionality to their properties and methods, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how dot notation and bracket notation are used to access/reassign properties and methods in JavaScript objects, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.

### One-on-One Meetings

The instructor will have a 15-minute one-on-one meeting with each student during the coming week: this will be an opportunity to review your progress, answer any questions you have, and discuss any topics the instructor sees appropriate, such as your future plans in the program. We will start the process of scheduling those meetings very soon.
