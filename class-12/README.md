## Feedback

- assignment due times different this week

- The paired programming and group experiences aren't bad, but they still aren't proving helpful.

- The help of the instructors and the TAs. I like how we worked in groups for chocolate pizza just so we get more exposure with paired programming.

- The work is challenging and I have a hard time balancing life/class.

- We did some git exercises on an external site and there were several concepts involving git revert that I was completely lost on and the exercise text listed the explanation in a way that made it seem like I should already know what it does and it wasn't helpful at all.

- Learning Journals are great, but are repetitive. Maybe once a week like feedback instead of twice.

- Get rid of the salmon cookies project. If there are better and faster ways to do something, why put us through something like the salmon cookie lab. I showed a person that's been in the industry for over 20+ years and he was like "what the #%&% is this?"

- Still feeling good.  Nice to jump into a project to practice some current skills without a bunch of new stuff.
